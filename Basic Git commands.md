# Simple steps for committing changes to GitHub

_Here's a concise guide for committing and pushing changes in Git using VSCode:_

## Step 1:  
Ensure You're in the Correct Directory: Open the terminal in VSCode and navigate to the directory where you made the changes.  
Check File Status:  
`Command: git status`  
Explanation: This shows the status of your files.

## Step 2:  
(Optional) Verify Remote Repository:  
`Command: git remote -v`  
Explanation: This checks if you’re connected to the correct GitHub repository.

## Step 3:  
Stage Your Changes:  
`Command: git add .`  
Explanation: This is a quick way to stage all changes in the current directory and below. It simplifies the process by allowing you to stage everything at once, rather than adding each file individually. To add a specific file, use git add "filename".

## Step 4:
Commit Your Changes:  
`Command: git commit -m "Your commit message"`  
Explanation: Replace "Your commit message" with a descriptive message about your changes.

## Step 5:
Push to the Repository:  
`Command: git push`  
Explanation: This pushes your changes to the remote repository.

_This sequence ensures your changes are correctly committed and pushed to the repository you're working with._
